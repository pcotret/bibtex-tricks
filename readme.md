The goal was to get a minimal working example with a few BibTeX tricks.

## Make an author bold, another underlined, etc.

Stackoverflow gave several solutions.

[This solution](https://www.sethajacobson.com/notes/2021/3/1/to-bold-and-italicize-specific-author-names-in-a-latex-generated-citation) seems to be the most simple even if it implies to modify the BST file. In this example, the reference BST is the [plain BST](http://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/tex/bibtex/plain.bst).

## Different BibTeX keys

- [Creating multiple bibliographies in the same document - Overleaf, Online LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Questions/Creating_multiple_bibliographies_in_the_same_document)

- [Multibib package](https://ctan.gutenberg-asso.fr/macros/latex/contrib/multibib/multibib.pdf)



I may add other BibTeX things in this document later.
