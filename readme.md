The goal was to get a minimal working example where I had to make an author bold, another underlined, etc. Stackoverflow gave several solutions.
[This solution](https://www.sethajacobson.com/notes/2021/3/1/to-bold-and-italicize-specific-author-names-in-a-latex-generated-citation) seems to be the most simple even if it implies to modify the BST file. In this example, the reference BST is the [plain BST](http://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/tex/bibtex/plain.bst).

I may add other BibTeX things in this document later.
